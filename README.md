## Hi ðŸ‘‹

_Iâ€™m Helen, an entrepreneur who speaks tech, an engineer who minds healthcare, a science enthusiast who loves art. I cultivate potentials at the intersection of these fields to create business values and social impacts. ...and I work in Finance._

**During my Master's journey at Cornell, I innovated (in aviation, in arts, in AI, in healthcare, in ...), where...**
- I developed a product idea called [Screening on Wheels](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_CWRcg6DSPSuMpZI5n2ZQFjcXwgsq0J/view) to mitigate airport opertional distruptions. This project was supported by Port Authority of NY & NJ and LaGuardia Gateway Partners, and was selected to be presented at Cornell's open studio event.
- I built a startup [ArtLÃ¦nd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xOkpgARWH3MyWNBCPxXVJwC65zO1oshH/view) to bridge the gap between emerging artists and business spaces, which boosts income for artists and breaks down barriers for space owners to access arts.
- I utilized generative AI tools to help newcomers enjoy classical music through multisensory integration.
  - [Tune - AI x Classical Music](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxFgxfMvSrVG5Ag6NDZ1fUpL7MlF1zqI/view)
- I studied data science for social change, and experimented writing a journal style article on the topic of AI doctor and related societal implications, targeting the general audience.
  - [Got an AI doctor? Reconsider telling it your race.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NTKiw9c9T0awc3UcXKL2nwWliVXXdDOT/view)
- I built models on YouTube data to investigate and identify patterns in user traffics, and came up with actionable strategies for content creators to improve video metrics with minimal efforts.

**I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Pharmacology at UC Santa Barbara, where...**
- I participated in a Data Science Capstone Project and studied a rare genetic mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.

  - [Final Report/Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vPySCN4vDqJvLGjy2PA4LOsAEz9317TR/view?usp=sharing)
- I tutored several introductory courses in the Department of Computer Science, including:
  - [CMPSC 32](https://ucsb-cs32.github.io/f19/info/syllabus/) - Object-Oriented Design
  - [CMPSC 16](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/s20/info/syllabus/) - Problem Solving with Computers I
  - [CMPSC 9](https://ucsb-cs9.github.io/f20/info/syllabus/) - Intermediate Python Programming
- I developed a [GitHub Beginner Guide](https://github.com/helenziyihuang/create_repo_demo) (See pdf inside) for novice users and implemented examples for illustration. Check out the example repo below with the Guide (in pdf) inside.
- I wrote several short scripts for use in Pharmacology labs, and some scripts in analyzing problems related to COVID-19 as well as biological dynamics. Check out some examples below.
  - [COVID-19 Analysis Using SIR Model](https://github.com/helenziyihuang/cs190dd_f20_COVID_19_SIR_project)
  - [t-test for Pharmacology Mouse Ear Lab](https://github.com/helenziyihuang/t-test_MouseEar_Pharmacology_Exp7)
  - [Chaotic System](https://github.com/helenziyihuang/mcdb172_f20_hw9_chaotic_system)
