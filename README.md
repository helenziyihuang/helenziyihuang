**Hi** ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Helen, a recent college graduate. I am interested in machine learning and computational science.
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Pharmacology at UC Santa Barbara, where...
- I participated in a Data Science Capstone Project and studied a rare genetic mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer's Disease. Check out the links below for more.

  - [Final report/paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vPySCN4vDqJvLGjy2PA4LOsAEz9317TR/view?usp=sharing)
- I tutored several introductory courses in the Department of Computer Science, including:
  - [CMPSC 32](https://ucsb-cs32.github.io/f19/info/syllabus/) - Object-Oriented Design
  - [CMPSC 16](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/s20/info/syllabus/) - Problem Solving with Computers I
  - [CMPSC 9](https://ucsb-cs9.github.io/f20/info/syllabus/) - Intermediate Python Programming
- I wrote several short scripts for use in Pharmacology labs, and some scripts in analyzing problems related to COVID-19 as well as biological dynamics. Check out some examples below.
