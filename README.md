## Hi ðŸ‘‹

_Iâ€™m Helen, a Master's student studying Computer Science at Cornell University. With background in various disciplines and an entrepreneurial mindset, I am passionate about exploring opportunities at the intersection of technology, healthcare, and business, and create values and social impacts from there._

<br/>

**During my Master's journey, I experience developing products and building startups, where...**
- I developed a product idea to mitigate airport opertional distruptions. This project was supported by Port Authority of NY & NJ and LaGuardia Gateway Partners, and was selected to be presented at Cornell's open event.

- I tutored several introductory courses in the Department of Computer Science, including:
  - [CMPSC 32](https://ucsb-cs32.github.io/f19/info/syllabus/) - Object-Oriented Design
  - [CMPSC 16](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/s20/info/syllabus/) - Problem Solving with Computers I
  - [CMPSC 9](https://ucsb-cs9.github.io/f20/info/syllabus/) - Intermediate Python Programming
- I developed a GitHub Beginner Guide for novice users and implemented examples for illustration. Check out the example repo below with the Guide (in pdf) inside.
  - [GitHub Beginner Guide](https://github.com/helenziyihuang/create_repo_demo) - See pdf inside the repo
- I wrote several short scripts for use in Pharmacology labs, and some scripts in analyzing problems related to COVID-19 as well as biological dynamics. Check out some examples below.
